"""Streamlit-powered web UI for Witness.

Run with: ``witness ui`` (or ``streamlit run witness/ui/app.py``).

Public re-exports:

  ``witness.ui.export``     — pure-Python markdown export helpers (no streamlit dep).
  ``witness.ui.components`` — reusable UI building blocks (streamlit dep).
  ``witness.ui.APP_PATH``   — file path to the Streamlit app.
