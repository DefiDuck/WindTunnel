# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-07

### Highlights

- **Streamlit web UI** (`witness ui`) with the full Witness design (dark, mono-heavy, Linear/Vercel-adjacent).
- **Rich-powered terminal output** for `witness diff` / `witness fingerprint` / `witness inspect` (auto-enabled when `rich` is installed).
- **Simple / Advanced mode** toggle in the UI sidebar — beginner-friendly default with one-click sample data.
- **Cross-page action buttons** and contextual hint banners that guide the user through capture → perturb → diff → fingerprint.
- **Ollama example** showing the OpenAI adapter works against any local model server.

### Web UI — interaction & UX

- **Drag-and-drop trace upload** + auto-discovery of `*.json` and `traces/*.trace.json` files in cwd.
- **First-run onboarding card** with three clear paths (Try sample data / Drop a trace / Capture from Python).
- **One-click sample data** generator (`witness.ui.generate_sample_traces()`) — captures a baseline + truncate-perturbed pair without touching disk.
- **Live progress + status panels** around replay and fingerprint loops (`st.status` with streamed detail, per-run progress bar).
- **Toast notifications** (`st.toast`) on every load / remove / perturbation-complete.
- **Click-to-expand decision rows** on Inspect (toggle to dataframe view in advanced mode).
- **Search & filter** on decisions, messages, diff timeline.
- **Decision-type filter chips** above the decision list (one chip per type seen, with counts).
- **Two-click confirm** on destructive actions (Remove a trace) with auto-cancel after 4 s.
- **Markdown export** on Diff / Perturb / Fingerprint / Inspect pages.
- **Fingerprint preset save / load** via JSON file (advanced mode).
- **Cross-page actions** — Inspect topbar has Diff / Perturb / Fingerprint buttons; Diff bottom has 3 next-action CTAs.
- **Contextual hint banner** on Load page — guides user to the next logical action based on how many traces are loaded.

### Web UI — Simple / Advanced mode

A real `st.toggle` widget in the sidebar with a dynamic label that flips Simple (white) → Advanced (red). Simple mode (the default) hides:
- the "Add by path" inline loader on Load,
- the messages and raw-JSON tabs on Inspect,
- the table-view toggle and 3 advanced perturbation types on Perturb (only `truncate` available),
- the preset save/load on Fingerprint.

Each simplified page also shows a one-line caption explaining the relevant concept (decision, perturbation, fingerprint).

### Web UI — visual design

Implemented the design handoff from Claude Design (dark-first, restrained,
mono-heavy aesthetic — Linear/Vercel/LangSmith adjacent). The UI now matches
the prototype's color palette, typography, and distinctive layouts:

- **Theme**: `#0a0a0a` background, `#fafafa` foreground, desaturated amber

Implemented the design handoff from Claude Design (dark-first, restrained,
mono-heavy aesthetic — Linear/Vercel/LangSmith adjacent). The UI now matches
the prototype's color palette, typography, and distinctive layouts:

- **Theme**: `#0a0a0a` background, `#fafafa` foreground, desaturated amber
  accent. Dark-first via `.streamlit/config.toml`, with full design
  tokens injected via custom CSS in `witness/ui/theme.py`.
- **Typography**: Inter (400/500/600/700) for body, JetBrains Mono for
  numbers and labels. 13px base size. 10.5px uppercase mono labels with
  letter-spacing for section headers.
- **Load page**: file-browser layout — column header with grid (filename,
  agent, decisions, model, size, modified), accent-bar selection indicator on
  active row, right-side inspector panel with KV pairs (dashed bottom borders),
  head-of-trace preview block.
- **Inspect page**: vertical decision flow with sequence line and dot nodes
  per decision; expandable JSON detail; right metadata panel with by-type
  counts and tools-available list.
- **Diff page** (the hero): 4-stat grid header (decisions changed, skipped,
  tool calls differing, final-output state) with 28px mono numbers; legend
  row; side-by-side panels with accent strip on the perturbed side; hatched-
  stripe placeholders for skipped/added rows; final-output diff footer with
  red `−` baseline / green `+` perturbed columns.
- **Perturb page**: numbered `01` / `02` / `03` sections matching design's
  scaffolded form; status panel + progress bar around the live replay.
- **Fingerprint page**: 3-column "headline" KvBig blocks (overall stability,
  weakest decision, most resilient); horizontal stability bars per decision
  type with low/mid/high color coding; comparison-style per-run table.
- **Sidebar**: branded header with version pill, mono uppercase nav label,
  active-screen indicator (status dot + live/idle), trace count footer.
- **Permanent ⌘K hint** at bottom-right (visual only — full hotkey support
  needs a custom JS component, not yet wired up).

All Tier-A functional features (drag-and-drop upload, live progress / status
panels, toast notifications, click-to-expand decision rows, search & filter,
designed empty states, two-click confirm-on-remove, markdown export, preset
save/load) are preserved on top of the new design.

### Web UI — functional polish (Tier A)

A second pass on the Streamlit UI focused on interaction quality, not visuals
(visual side is a parallel workstream).

- **Drag-and-drop trace upload** — replaces the path-only input with
  `st.file_uploader(accept_multiple_files=True)`. Path input remains under an
  expander for power users.
- **Live progress + status panels** — replays and fingerprint loops now use
  `st.status` with streamed detail; fingerprint also shows a per-run progress
  bar (`Running 2/4: prompt_injection…`).
- **Toast notifications** — short non-blocking feedback (`st.toast`) on every
  load / remove / perturbation-complete. No more inline success banners.
- **Click-to-expand decision rows** — Inspect page renders decisions as
  expanders by default; toggle to switch to the dataframe view.
- **Search & filter** — text input above decisions, messages, and the diff
  timeline; live case-insensitive filter across all columns.
- **Designed empty states** — "No traces loaded" pages now offer a CTA button
  that switches to the Load page.
- **Confirmation on destructive actions** — Remove a trace requires a second
  click (auto-resets after 4 s).
- **Markdown export** — Diff, Perturb, Fingerprint, and Inspect pages each
  expose a "Download as markdown" button. Output is paste-ready for PR
  descriptions / Slack / docs.
- **Fingerprint preset save/load** — download the current perturbation list as
  JSON, upload it later to repeat the exact fingerprint config on a new
  baseline.
- **`witness.ui.export`** — new pure-Python module: `diff_to_markdown`,
  `fingerprint_to_markdown`, `trace_to_markdown`, `preset_to_json /
  preset_from_json`. No streamlit dependency, importable from anywhere.
- **`witness.ui.components`** — extracted reusable widgets (`empty_state`,
  `confirm_button`, `search_input`, `filter_rows`, `decision_expander`,
  `decision_list`, `markdown_download`, `StatusPanel`).
- **Tests** — 96 → 132. Added `tests/test_ui_export.py`,
  `tests/test_ui_components.py`, and `tests/test_ui_apptest.py` (AppTest-based
  per-page render checks).

### Added (earlier in this Unreleased block)
- **Rich-powered terminal output** for `witness diff`, `witness fingerprint`, and
  `witness inspect`. Boxed panels, tables, color-coded change badges, stability
  bar charts. Auto-enabled when `rich` is installed; pass `--plain` for the
  legacy ANSI renderer. Available via `pip install "witness[rich]"` or
  `pip install "witness[ui]"`.
- **Streamlit web UI** (`witness ui`) — five-page interactive app:
  Load traces, Inspect, Diff, Perturb & Replay, Fingerprint. Run perturbations
  live in the browser, see diffs render with side-by-side panels, see stability
  bar charts. Available via `pip install "witness[ui]"`.
- `examples/ollama_research_agent.py` — end-to-end demo against a local Ollama
  model via the OpenAI adapter (no Ollama-specific code in the library).
- CLI auto-reconfigures stdout/stderr to UTF-8 on Windows so rich box-drawing
  characters render in cmd.exe and PowerShell 5.

## v0.1.0 — initial release

The MVP from `BUILD.md` (capture / perturb / diff), plus everything in the
"stretch" list except the web UI and trace-import integrations.

### Capture
- `@witness.observe()` decorator — sync + async, contextvar-based, bare and parameterized forms
- `witness.record_decision()` for manual instrumentation
- Anthropic SDK adapter — auto-records `messages.create` calls (sync + async)
- OpenAI SDK adapter — auto-records `chat.completions.create` calls (sync + async)
- Stable JSON trace schema (`trace_v1`) with forward-compat `extra="allow"`
  on every model
- Schema published as JSON Schema at `witness/schema/trace_v1.json`

### Perturb
- `Truncate(fraction=...)` — drop trailing N% of context
- `PromptInjection(text=...)` — append a hostile instruction
- `ModelSwap(target=...)` — replace the model identifier
- `ToolRemoval(tool=...)` — remove a tool from `tools_available`
- `witness.replay_context()` — agents can honor model/tool overrides during replay
- `witness.replay()` — programmatic counterfactual replay with auto-save suppression

### Diff
- LCS-based decision alignment with `same` / `input_changed` / `output_changed` / `both_changed` / `added` / `removed` / `type_changed` classification
- Color-coded terminal renderer
- `witness.diff.fingerprint()` — N-perturbation behavioral signature
  with stability scores per decision type and an overall (geometric-mean) score

### CLI
- `witness diff baseline.json perturbed.json` (color or `--json`, `-v` for verbose)
- `witness perturb baseline.json --type ... --param k=v -o ...` (with optional `--no-rerun` snapshot mode)
- `witness inspect <trace>` — pretty summary of a trace
- `witness perturbations` — list registered perturbation types
- `witness fingerprint baseline.json --run truncate:fraction=0.25 --run prompt_injection`
- `witness schema [--regenerate|--path]`

### Tests
- 96 unit tests covering schema, store, capture, perturbations, diff, replay, fingerprint, schema export, CLI, and end-to-end demo flow
- Integration test suite (`tests/integration/`) gated on `RUN_INTEGRATION=1`
  with real Anthropic API call
